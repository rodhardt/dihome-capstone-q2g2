DIHOME

Dihome is a project made by 4 students from Kenzie Academy Brazil with React.
The application is on the real state market, where the goal is for property owners to make selling / renting announcements by themselves, without an agent taking 7% off the sale as a commission.
However, to keep the announcements appealing, trustworthy and fair, there are consultants to approve the offers and give suggestions.

The goal is to show how the website would work for the user with all the main features - though some of them are simplified or incomplete, such as: subscribe payment system, chat between property owner and buyer, and even the data flow, since the json-server (fake REST API) was used.
